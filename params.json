  "body": "**DeepAlgebra** is an open-source AI project with a goal to automate formalization of mathematics and theorem proving. In particular we are interested in teaching machines to prove entirely new theorems, not proved before by humans. We concentrate on algebra and algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\n## Plan:\r\n\r\nThe technical background for what we do is explained here: \r\n\r\n[DeepAlgebra - an outline of a program](http://arxiv), Przemyslaw Chojecki\r\n\r\nWe currently want to implement a dictionary between (La)Tex and [COQ](https://coq.inria.fr) using syntactic parsers, and test it on [The Stacks Project](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu). The code will eventually appear on this website.\r\n\r\n`Technical plan:`\r\n* Build a dictionary by using [SyntaxNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/syntaxnet/index.html) or a similar syntactic parser to identify Types and variables in a mathematical text. Transfer those to COQ using a parse tree and a rule-based approach machine translation for environments and plain English. \r\n* Test this dictionary on the Stacks Project (a repository of facts from algebraic geometry).\r\n* Proceed to verification and theorem proving using[ E ](http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/E.html)in COQ and hammers (a deep learning method). \r\n\r\n\r\n## Our Team:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/przchojecki/deepalgebra/gh-pages/ja.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Przemyslaw Chojecki** - founder of the DeepAlgebra project; born in 1988 in Warsaw, Poland, got a Master in Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique (Paris, France) and University of Warsaw (Poland), then obtained a PhD in Mathematics from Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris, France). He was a Research Fellow at University of Oxford (United Kingdom) from 2014 to 2016. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board in [deepsense.io](http://deepsense.io/scientific-advisory-board/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support:\r\n\r\nIf you want to **join us**, write to: prz{dot}chojecki[at]gmail{dot}com, listing your experience and interests. We are currently looking for an implementation team, so anyone with advanced Python+TensorFlow skills is appreciated!\r\n\r\nIf you want to **support this project** in any other way, please also use the above email.",
