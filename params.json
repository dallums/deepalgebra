  "body": "**DeepAlgebra** is an open-source project in AI with a goal to automate formalization of mathematics and theorem proving. Especially we are interested in teaching machines to prove entirely new theorems, not proved before by humans. We concentrate on algebra and algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\n## Plan:\r\n\r\nThe technical background for what we do is explained here: \r\n\r\nWe currently want to implement a dictionary between (La)Tex and COQ using syntactic parsers, and test it on The Stacks Project. The code will eventually appear on this website.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Our Team:\r\n\r\n/Users/pchojecki/Desktop/ja3.jpg\r\n\r\n**Przemyslaw Chojecki** - founder of the DeepAlgebra project; born 1988, MD in mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique (Paris, France) and University of Warsaw (Poland), PhD in mathematics from Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, was a research fellow at University of Oxford from 2014 to 2016.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to join, write to: prz{dot}chojecki[at]gmail{dot}com, listing your experience and interests. We are currently looking for the implementation team, so anyone with advanced Python+TensorFlow skills is appreciated!\r\n",
